<p>
A small personal project I did over the summer. To gain some experience with data collection using web scraping, I used the Selenium package,
along with Pandas. This script uses a company's ticker symbol to collect all insider acquisition transactions since 2018 from EDGAR.
The output is in CSV form. Hoping for some future projects involving stock prices and analysis with this script.
