Final project for University of Washington course STAT 403, Introduction to Resampling inference.
Using data collected by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), my group took a look at the similarities and difference in overall and specific spending habits between the Republican and Democratic party candidates for the 2022 cycle. The techniques in this project are mainly empirical bootstrap, resampling, and permutation tests, and the code used was in R.
