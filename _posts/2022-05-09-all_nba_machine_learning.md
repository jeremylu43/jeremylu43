Final paper for NYU course APSTA-GE 2047, Messy Data and Machine Learning. 
We take an in depth look at the Bernhard Hientzsch's 2019 paper "Introduction to Solving Quant Finance Problems with
Time-Stepped FBSDE and Deep Learning", which explains how you can use a forward backward approach with deep neural networks
for financial problems such as option pricing. We also reproduced the paper's code and produced graphical results.
