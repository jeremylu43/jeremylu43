<p>
Created a poster for my work as a research assistant with the UW Atmoshperic Sciences Department, for a virtual symposium.
Our team analyzed SOCRATES cloud data and used it in order . I learned the techniques of data management, organization, along with implementing and evaluating random forest models.
Technically, I was introduced to working on Jupyter Notebooks, and using the SciKit-Learn packages.

Attached below is both the poster created and an audio recording about our project.
