This was an assignment I did while taking the HCDE 210 (Explorations in Human Centered Design) class at the UW. Using data from [Seattle's Open Data Initiative](http://www.seattle.gov/tech/initiatives/open-data), I used Tableau to analyze Seattle's 911 Incident Reponse database and found quality possible locations for a food truck.
