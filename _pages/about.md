Hi, I'm Jeremy.

I'm a second year graduate student at **New York University** studying **Applied Statistics for Social Science Research**, currently looking for
full time opportunities as a data analyst/scientist/researcher after graduating in MAy 2023. I did my undergraduate studies at the **University of Washington** (UW), earning a Bachelor's of Science Degree in **Applied and Computational Mathmatical Sciences**, with a **Data Science** option.

I have an interest in **problem solving**, mainly involving data and its applications in sports, particularly basketball, football, and soccer. I have experience as an **AI Research Intern** with Aizip, Inc., a startup specializing in TinyML and AIoT.
Additionally, I was a **research assistant** for the UW Atmospheric Sciences Department involved with binary classification of ice probe data. Finally, I run the YouTube channel **Hoodfav Hoops**, where I do player breakdowns and analysis using game film and data.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing **basketball**, **cooking**, and listening to **music**. If you ever have questions or would like to chat just email me :)
