Hi, I'm Jeremy.

I'm a second year graduate student at **New York University** studying **Applied Statistics for Social Science Research**. I did my undergraduate studies at the **University of Washington** (UW), earning a Bachelor's of Science Degree in **Applied and Computational Mathmatical Sciences**, with a **Data Science** option.

I have an interest in **problem solving**, mainly involving data and its applications in sports, particularly basketball, football, and soccer. I was a research assistant for the UW Atmospheric Sciences Department involved with machine learning, and am currently looking for any research or full time opportunities as a data analyst/scientist/researcher. 

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing **basketball**, **cooking**, and listening to **music**. If you ever have questions or would like to chat just email me :)
