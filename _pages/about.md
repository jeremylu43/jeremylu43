Hi, I'm Jeremy.

I'm a third year student at the **University of Washington** studying **Applied and Computational Mathmatical Sciences**, with a **Data Science** option.

I have an interest in **problem solving**, mainly involving data and its applications in sports, particularly basketball, football, and soccer. Currently I am a **research assistant** for the Atmospheric Sciences Department. 

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing **basketball** and am involved in an on campus fellowship, **AAIV**. If you ever have questions or would like to chat just email me :)
